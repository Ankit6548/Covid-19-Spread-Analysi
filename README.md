# Covid-19-Spread-Analysis

This Project will help us understand how 2019-nCoV is spread around the world. I developed a dashboard viz using Tableau. Linked the data tables to fetch the data country-wise. Used country & case observed date filters, bar & line graphs to show visualizations which made comparison between two or many countries very easy. Active cases, recovered cases, number of deaths, number of tests performed helps us to get insights of the spread compared to other countries. A calculated field was proposed to see the percentage drop change in the daily cases. Data Source- Kaggle, Link- https://lnkd.in/dBPYmCr
